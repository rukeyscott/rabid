We have a lot of plans for things to add to Milestone 3.  So far, we have a basic 1st person survival shooter game with a Main Menu page, Level Menu page, Credits Menu page, and 3 different levels: Island Paradise, Southwest, and Mars.
For our next milestone, we plan to add features such as:
•	Player hunger and thirst
•	Different player physics for the Mars level allowing player to jump further, etc
•	Ability to save where you are in the game and pick up where you left off
•	Ability to increase players abilities such as run and jump farther and faster based on number of kills or time played
•	Possibly add quests or objectives to get achievement awards or special weapons
•	Add more variety in enemies with special abilities
•	Make it so that enemies spawn from random locations
•	Add objects that you must collect in order to win the game
